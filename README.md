# mION

This code solves mass, momentum and energy conservation equations for any number of ion species in a fully ionized plasma, in slab or (one-dimensional) spherical coordinates.

The mass and energy continuity equations for the plasma electrons are automatically satisfied by assuming quasi-neutrality and zero-current condition.

The electric field is calculated by the usual Ohm's law eE = - grad(p)/ne.
